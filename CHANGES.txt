Change log for gocept.download
==============================


1.0 (unreleased)
================

- Nothing changed yet.


0.9.5 (2010-07-26)
==================

  - Fixed md5 computation on Windows.

  - Fixed deprecation warnings caused by imports of md5 (moved inside hashlib
    in newer Python versions) and doctest (deprecated in favour of the
    standard lib's version in newer zope.testing versions).

0.9.4
=====

  - Copy downloaded files that are not archives of any known type to the
    part's location.

  - download-directory is now a part option that defaults to a buildout option
    of the same name.

  - Only create and use a directory for storing downloaded resources if the
    download-directory option is specified.

  - Take advantage of zc.buildout's download cache.

  - Added tests.

0.9.3
=====

  - Added an option named "destination" to specify a directory to extract to.
    If this option is given, its value must be an existent, empty directory,
    and no part directory will be created. This is useful for extracting
    source code to a temporary build directory, for example.

  - Fixed tar.bz2 extraction.

  - Temporary extract directory has a better name now to ease debugging.

0.9.2
=====

  - Try to create part directory only after downloading and unpacking the
    archive. This avoids an empty part directory if something goes wrong.

0.9.1
=====

  - Fail if part directory exists already.
