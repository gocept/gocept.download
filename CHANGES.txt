0.9.3
=====

  - Added an option named "destination" to specify a directory to extract to.
    If this option is given, its value must be an existent, empty directory,
    and no part directory will be created. This is useful for extracting
    source code to a temporary build directory, for example.

  - Fixed tar.bz2 extraction.

  - Temporary extract directory has a better name now to ease debugging.

0.9.2
=====

  - Try to create part directory only after downloading and unpacking the
    archive. This avoids an empty part directory if something goes wrong.

0.9.1
=====

  - Fail if part directory exists already.
