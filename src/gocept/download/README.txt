gocept.download - A zc.buildout recipe to download and extract an archive
=========================================================================

Downloading a file
==================

The gocept.download recipe downloads a resource from a URL and verifies its
MD5 checksum. If the file isn't an archive of a known type, it is simply
placed in the buildout part's location:

    >>> import os.path
    >>> import md5

    >>> resource = os.path.join(tmpdir("server"), "resource")
    >>> write(resource, "foo")

    >>> write("buildout.cfg", """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = download
    ...
    ... [download]
    ... recipe = gocept.download
    ... url = file://%(resource)s
    ... md5sum = %(md5sum)s
    ...
    ... """ % {"resource": resource,
    ...        "md5sum": md5.new("foo").hexdigest()}
    ... )

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Installing download.

    >>> ls("parts", "download")
    -  resource

    >>> cat("parts", "download", "resource")
    foo

We can specify a download directory into which the recipe will place a copy of
the downloaded file. This allows, for example, to create a distribution
including all downloaded files. Either an absolute or a relative file system
path to the download directory may be given; a relative path is considered
relative to the buildout directory:

    >>> write("buildout.cfg", """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = download
    ...
    ... [download]
    ... recipe = gocept.download
    ... download-directory = download-directory
    ... url = file://%(resource)s
    ... md5sum = %(md5sum)s
    ...
    ... """ % {"resource": resource,
    ...        "md5sum": md5.new("foo").hexdigest()}
    ... )

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

    >>> ls("download-directory")
    -  resource

    >>> cat("download-directory", "resource")
    foo

The resource will not be downloaded again from the URL once it exists in the
download directory:

    >>> write(resource, "bar")
    >>> remove("parts", "download")

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

    >>> cat("download-directory", "resource")
    foo

    >>> cat("parts", "download", "resource")
    foo


Using the download cache
========================

When downloading a resource from its URL, the recipe tries to take advantage
of buildout's download cache. So far no download cache has been used, so let's
create one:

    >>> download_cache = tmpdir("download-cache")
    >>> ls(download_cache)

We reset our resource and buildout and configure the latter to have a part
that downloads the resource to the download directory, using the cache:

    >>> write(resource, "foo")
    >>> remove("parts", "download")
    >>> remove("download-directory", "resource")

    >>> write("buildout.cfg", """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = download
    ... download-cache = %(download_cache)s
    ...
    ... [download]
    ... recipe = gocept.download
    ... download-directory = download-directory
    ... url = file://%(resource)s
    ... md5sum = %(md5sum)s
    ...
    ... """ % {"download_cache": download_cache,
    ...        "resource": resource,
    ...        "md5sum": md5.new("foo").hexdigest()}
    ... )

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

The downloaded file will now be placed in the download cache in addition to
the locations seen so far (the "dist" directory being created for buildout's
own needs):

    >>> ls(download_cache)
    d  dist
    -  resource

    >>> cat(download_cache, "resource")
    foo

    >>> cat("download-directory", "resource")
    foo

    >>> cat("parts", "download", "resource")
    foo

The same resource will not be downloaded again after it has been placed in the
download cache:

    >>> write(resource, "bar")
    >>> remove("parts", "download")
    >>> remove("download-directory", "resource")

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

    >>> cat(download_cache, "resource")
    foo

    >>> cat("download-directory", "resource")
    foo

    >>> cat("parts", "download", "resource")
    foo


Extracting an archive
=====================

If the downloaded file is an archive of a type known to gocept.download, it
gets automatically extracted:

    >>> import pkg_resources

    >>> resource = pkg_resources.resource_filename(
    ...     "gocept.download", "sample.tar.gz")
    >>> sample = pkg_resources.resource_string(
    ...     "gocept.download", "sample.tar.gz")

    >>> write("buildout.cfg", """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = download
    ...
    ... [download]
    ... recipe = gocept.download
    ... download-directory = download-directory
    ... url = file://%(resource)s
    ... md5sum = %(md5sum)s
    ...
    ... """ % {"resource": resource,
    ...        "md5sum": md5.new(sample).hexdigest()}
    ... )

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

    >>> ls("download-directory")
    -  ...
    -  sample.tar.gz

    >>> ls("parts", "download")
    -  LICENSE.txt

Our example archive contains a top-level directory which was, by default,
stripped away after extracting. We can suppress the stripping:

    >>> write("buildout.cfg", """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = download
    ...
    ... [download]
    ... recipe = gocept.download
    ... download-directory = download-directory
    ... url = file://%(resource)s
    ... md5sum = %(md5sum)s
    ... strip-top-level-dir = false
    ...
    ... """ % {"resource": resource,
    ...        "md5sum": md5.new(sample).hexdigest()}
    ... )

    >>> print system(buildout),
    Uninstalling download.
    Installing download.

    >>> ls("parts", "download")
    d  top-level

    >>> ls("parts", "download", "top-level")
    -  LICENSE.txt
